I stand before the mirror, trying to see myself through others’ eyes, but nothing satisfies them… not even me. But greed is a silent poison; it strips the soul piece by piece. Perfection consumes the spirit before the body. The hardest part is being the example your soul longs to rest from. Perhaps perfection is an illusion, yet I still chase it, though my heart knows I have always been enough. When you chase everything… you lose the one thing that truly mattered— yourself. To have it all… or nothing at all.",

And when he reached out to pull me from the darkness, I didn’t find salvation in him, but in the self I had been running from all along.",

In the end, nothing is worth sacrificing yourself for… except those who deserve to stay with you in both shadow and light. Love isn’t always gentle. My love burns, possesses, and leaves ashes in place of hearts. I didn’t want peace… I wanted her, even if it meant a war with myself. They called me obsessive, maybe they were right. But obsession is love that forgot how to die. I tried to protect her from the world, forgetting that the world inside her was stronger than any danger outside.",

And sometimes… attachment isn’t love — it’s the fear of becoming empty again. My love for him was silent, deep, stronger than all the words I failed to say. I saw him in everything, and I feared he would break me if he ever knew what was in my heart. He didn’t save me from the darkness… he showed me that I was the darkness, and that it wasn’t a sin. I learned that some feelings don’t need to be declared — they simply need to be lived, even if they remain hidden forever. I wasn’t afraid of dying… I was afraid of dying before he knew that I loved him more than I loved myself.

Sometimes survival makes you feel like a traitor… especially when those you love don’t come with you. Fear-driven mistakes are always worse than betrayal. True forgiveness is when you forgive someone who doesn’t even know they hurt you. Hate is easier than pain… but it kills you slower. Some break you to remind themselves you’re human, others love you for the same reason. Family isn’t always blood… sometimes it’s the hand that pulls you from ruin.",
